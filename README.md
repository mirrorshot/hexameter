# Hexameter

Hexameter is a hexagonal grid library. The motivation behind it is to have
an optimized, simple and usable library for drawing hexagonal grids without
being tied to any GUI framework. So it works on Android, SWT, Swing, you
name it! It is **100% unit tested** so you don't have to worry about something
going wrong.

Pull reqeusts are also welcome!*

## Possible grid layouts:

 - Triangular
 - Rectangular
 - Trapezoid
 - Custom

## Supported operations
 - Getting a hexagon by its grid coordinate
 - Getting a hexagon by its pixel coordinate
 - Getting the neighbors of a hexagon

 - Calculating the movement range from a hexagon
 - Pathfinding with obstacles
 
## Miscallaneous operations
 - Adding/removing a Hexagon from the grid
 - Checking whether a Hexagon is on a grid or not 
 - Supplying a custom storage object 
 - Adding custom data to a Hexagon
